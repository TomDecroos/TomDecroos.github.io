# Tom Decroos - PhD Researcher in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Soccer Analytics
![Headshot of Tom](headshot_tom_small.jpg)

I am a 4th year PhD student in the DTAI Research group at KU Leuven working with Prof. [Jesse Davis (https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/). I research how to _learn_ from complex data streams (using both predictive and descriptive machine learning methods) with a focus on soccer analytics.

# Internships
### Software Engineer (Machine Learning) at Facebook
PhD internship from June 2018 to August 2018 training and evaluating deep neural networks that recommend ads to over 2 billion users. I improved existing production models to (a) be more robust in A/A tests and (b) use less privacy-sensitive user data.

# Software
I am the author of two soccer-related pip packages:
- `socceraction` [[https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction)]: Convert soccer event stream data from commercial vendors (e.g., Opta, Wyscout, StatsBomb) to actions in the simpler SPADL language and value the actions using the VAEP framework.
- `matplotsoccer` [[https://github.com/TomDecroos/matplotsoccer](https://github.com/TomDecroos/matplotsoccer)]: Visualize soccer event stream data and common figures such as heatmaps over a soccer field.

# Awards
* AAAI-17 Student Travel Award by AAAI in December 2016.
* **Personal 4-year PhD scholarship** (aspirant) from FWO Flanders from October 2017 until September 2021.
* KDD-19 Student Travel Award by KDD in June 2019.
* **KDD-19 Best Paper in the Applied Data Science Track** (out of >700 submitted papers)

# Media
Our work on valuing actions in soccer appeared in numerous newspapers and media outlets:
